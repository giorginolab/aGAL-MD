	abstract = {Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme, α-galactosidase A that induces the accumulation of the substrate globotriaosylceramide. Currently approved enzyme replacement therapy using recombinant human α-galactosidase A improves patient symptoms but a majority of patients experience adverse events due to the multiple infusions required for full therapeutic efficacy. Our approach is to use medicinal chemistry and phylogenic comparisons to introduce mutations into the human enzyme to increase catalytic activity and/or stability to generate an improved therapeutic enzyme that may require fewer infusions. We designed mutations at three regions of the human α-galactosidase A: the active site, the dimer interface, and a site for glycosylation. The M208E mutation, adjacent to the Y207 active site residue, increased enzyme activity 3.01-fold. This mutation introduced a charged Glu residue that is adjacent to the Y207 active site residue and close to a site of N-glycosylation. The W277C mutation, designed to promote dimer stability, introduced a strong thiol-aromatic interaction (Cys-Phe) at the dimer interface and increased activity 2.31-fold. The W277C and M208E mutations modify the structure of the enzyme into forms with enhanced thermal stability 3.7- and 3.9fold, respectively and positive cooperativity resulting in increased Hill coefficient from 1.0 to 4.60 and 3.47, respectively. Enhanced thermal stability and positive cooperativity predict improved in vivo activity and superior therapeutic properties. Our results demonstrate the value of in vitro mutagenesis for α-galactosidase A and support future perspectives to validate these results in Fabry disease patients.},

	abstract = {Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, X‑linked lysosomal storage disorder affecting both males and females caused by genetic abnormalities in the gene encoding the enzyme α‑galactosidase A. FD‑affected patients represent a highly variable clinical course with first symptoms already appearing in young age. The disease causes a progressive multiple organ dysfunction affecting mostly the heart, kidneys and nervous system, eventually leading to premature death. Disease‑specific management of FD includes enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase α and β or pharmacological oral chaperone migalastat. Migalastat is a low‑molecular‑mass iminosugar, that reversibly binds to active site of ame‑nable enzyme variants, stabilizing their molecular structure and improving trafficking to the lysosome. Migalastat was approved in the EU in 2016 and is an effective therapy in the estimated 35–50\% of all patients with FD with ame‑nable GLA gene variants. This position statement is the first comprehensive review in Central and Eastern Europe of the current role of migalastat in the treatment of FD. The statement provides an overview of the pharmacology of migalastat and summarizes the current evidence from the clinical trial program regarding the safety and efficacy of the drug and its effects on organs typically involved in FD. The position paper also includes a practical guide for cli‑nicians on the optimal selection of patients with FD who will benefit from migalastat treatment, recommendations on the optimal selection of diagnostic tests and the use of tools to identify patients with amenable GLA mutations. Areas for future migalastat clinical research have also been identified.},

	abstract = {The use of pharmacological chaperones (PCs) to stabilize specific enzymes and impart a therapeutic benefit is an emerging strategy in drug discovery. However, designing molecules that can bind optimally to their targets at physiological pH remains a major challenge. Our previous study found that dibasic polyhydroxylated pyrrolidine 5 exhibited superior pH-selective inhibitory activity and chaperoning activity for human α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) compared with its monobasic parent molecule, 4. To further investigate the role of different C-2 moieties on the pH-selectivity and protecting effects of these compounds, we designed and synthesized a library of monobasic and dibasic iminosugars, screened them for α-Gal A-stabilizing activity using thermal shift and heatinduced denaturation assays, and characterized the mechanistic basis for this stabilization using X-ray crystallography and binding assays. We noted that the dibasic iminosugars 5 and 20 protect α-Gal A from denaturation and inactivation at lower concentrations than monobasic or other N-substituted derivatives; a finding attributed to the nitrogen on the C-2 methylene of 5 and 20, which forms the bifurcated salt bridges (BSBs) with two carboxyl residues, E203 and D231. Additionally, the formation of BSBs at pH 7.0 and the electrostatic repulsion between the vicinal ammonium cations of dibasic iminosugars at pH 4.5 are responsible for their pH-selective binding to α-Gal A. Moreover, compounds 5 and 20 demonstrated promising results in improving enzyme replacement therapy and exhibited significant chaperoning effects in Fabry cells. These findings suggest amino-iminosugars 5 and 20 as useful models to demonstrate how an additional exocyclic amino group can improve their pH-selectivity and protecting effects, providing new insights for the design of pH-selective PCs.},

	abstract = {Background—Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common type of cardiomyopathy, but many patients lack sarcomeric/myofilament mutations. We studied whether cardio-specific α-galactosidase A gene variants are misinterpreted as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy because of the lack of extracardiac organ involvement.
Methods and Results—All subjects who tested positive for the N215S genotype (n=26, 13 females, mean age 49±17 [range, 14–74] years) were characterized in this prospective monocentric longitudinal cohort study to determine genotype-specific clinical characteristics of the N215S (c.644A{\textgreater}G [p.Asn215Ser]) α-galactosidase A gene variant. All subjects were initially referred with suspicion of genetically determined hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Cardiac hypertrophy (interventricular septum, 12±4 [7–23] mm; left ventricular posterior wall, 11±4 [7–21] mm; left ventricular mass, 86±41 [46–195] g/ m2) was progressive, systolic function mainly preserved (cardiac index 2.8±0.6 [1.9–3.9] L/min per m2), and diastolic function mildly abnormal. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed replacement fibrosis in loco typico (18/26, 69\%), particularly in subjects {\textgreater}50 years. Elderly subjects had advanced heart failure, and 6 (23\%) were suggested for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy. Leukocyte α-galactosidase A enzyme activity was mildly reduced in 19 subjects and lyso-globotriaosylceramide slightly elevated (median, 4.9; interquartile range, 1.3–9.1 ng/mL). Neurological and renal impairments (serum creatinine, 0.87±0.20; median, 0.80; interquartile range, 0.70–1.01 mg/dL; glomerular filtration rate, 102±23; median, 106; interquartile range, 84–113 mL/min) were discreet. Only 2 subjects developed clinically relevant proteinuria.
Conclusions—α-Galactosidase A genotype N215S does not lead to the development of a classical Fabry phenotype but induces a specific cardiac variant of Fabry disease mimicking nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The lack of prominent noncardiac impairment leads to a significant delay in diagnosis and Fabry-specific therapy. (Circ Cardiovasc Genet. 2017;10:e001691. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.116.001691.)},

Results: 79 patients were recruited (48 M:31F; median duration receiving migalastat 3.8 years [range = 0.4–14.9 years]). N215S was the commonest genotype in males (67 \%) and females (29 \%). Leukocyte α-Gal-A showed a positive change from baseline in males (n = 4; median = 20.05); females (n = 8; median = 26). Of these, 3 males and 1 female had N215S (median = 16.7), while 7 females and 1 male had other genotypes (median = 26). No significant changes observed in plasma α-Gal-A. Cross-sectional analysis of post-baseline data confirmed leukocyte α-Gal-A enhancement in males (n = 47; median = 20); females (n = 30; median = 72); N215S (n = 41; median = 29) and other genotypes (n = 36; median = 36.5). Plasma and dried blood spot (DBS) lyso-Gb3 correlated at baseline and post-baseline (r = 0.77 and r = 0.96; p={\textless}0.0001).
Conclusions: In the 12 patients with paired data, there was a median enzyme enhancement of 17.4 (relative change = 2.54) and 33 (relative change = 0.87) in males and in females, respectively. The cross-sectional postbaseline data in 47 patients corroborated leukocyte α-Gal-A enhancement on migalastat. Plasma and DBS lysoGb3 correlated well supporting DBS utility for disease monitoring.},

	abstract = {Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of α-Gal A (α-galactosidase A) activity. In order to understand the molecular mechanism underlying α-Gal A deficiency in Fabry disease patients with residual enzyme activity, enzymes with different missense mutations were purified from transfected COS-7 cells and the biochemical properties were characterized. The mutant enzymes detected in variant patients (A20P, E66Q, M72V, I91T, R112H, F113L, N215S, Q279E, M296I, M296V and R301Q), and those found mostly in mild classic patients (A97V, A156V, L166V and R356W) appeared to have normal Km and Vmax values. The degradation of all mutants (except E59K) was partially inhibited by treatment with kifunensine, a selective inhibitor of ER (endoplasmic reticulum) α-mannosidase I. Metabolic labelling and subcellular fractionation studies in COS-7 cells expressing the L166V and R301Q α-Gal A mutants indicated that the mutant protein was retained in the ER and degraded without processing. Addition of DGJ (1-deoxygalactonojirimycin) to the culture medium of COS-7 cells transfected with a large set of missense mutant α-Gal A cDNAs effectively increased both enzyme activity and protein yield. DGJ was capable of normalizing intracellular processing of mutant α-Gal A found in both classic (L166V) and variant (R301Q) Fabry disease patients. In addition, the residual enzyme activity in fibroblasts or lymphoblasts from both classic and variant hemizygous Fabry disease patients carrying a variety of missense mutations could be substantially increased by cultivation of the cells with DGJ. These results indicate that a large proportion of mutant enzymes in patients with residual enzyme activity are kinetically active. Excessive degradation in the ER could be responsible for the deficiency of enzyme activity in vivo, and the DGJ approach may be broadly applicable to Fabry disease patients with missense mutations.},

We have investigated the structure and stability of GCase and R-Gal A in a neutral-pH environment reflective of the endoplasmic reticulum and an acidic-pH environment reflective of the lysosome. These details are important for the development of pharmacological chaperone therapy for Gaucher and Fabry disease, in which small molecules bind mutant enzymes in the ER to enable the mutant enzyme to meet quality control requirements for lysosomal trafficking. We report crystal structures of apo GCase at pH 4.5, at pH 5.5, and in complex with the pharmacological chaperone isofagomine (IFG) at pH 7.5. We also present thermostability analysis of GCase at pH 7.4 and 5.2 using differential scanning calorimetry. We compare our results with analogous experiments using R-Gal A and the chaperone 1-deoxygalactonijirimycin (DGJ), including the first structure of R-Gal A with DGJ. Both GCase and R-Gal A are more stable at lysosomal pH with and without their respective iminosugars bound, and notably, the stability of the GCase-IFG complex is pH sensitive. We show that the conformations of the active site loops in GCase are sensitive to ligand binding but not pH, whereas analogous galactose- or DGJ-dependent conformational changes in R-Gal A are not seen. Thermodynamic parameters obtained from R-Gal A unfolding indicate two-state, van’t Hoff unfolding in the absence of the iminosugar at neutral and lysosomal pH, and non-two-state unfolding in the presence of DGJ. Taken together, these results provide insight into how GCase and R-Gal A are thermodynamically stabilized by iminosugars and suggest strategies for the development of new pharmacological chaperones for lysosomal storage disorders.},

	abstract = {While the quality of the current CHARMM22/CMAP additive force field for proteins has been demonstrated in a large number of applications, limitations in the model with respect to the equilibrium between the sampling of helical and extended conformations in folding simulations have been noted. To overcome this, as well as make other improvements in the model, we present a combination of refinements that should result in enhanced accuracy in simulations of proteins. The common (non Gly, Pro) backbone CMAP potential has been refined against experimental solution NMR data for weakly structured peptides, resulting in a rebalancing of the energies of the α-helix and extended regions of the Ramachandran map, correcting the α-helical bias of CHARMM22/CMAP. The Gly and Pro CMAPs have been refitted to more accurate quantum-mechanical energy surfaces. Side-chain torsion parameters have been optimized by fitting to backbone-dependent quantum-mechanical energy surfaces, followed by additional empirical optimization targeting NMR scalar couplings for unfolded proteins. A comprehensive validation of the revised force field was then performed against data not used to guide parametrization: (i) comparison of simulations of eight proteins in their crystal environments with crystal structures; (ii) comparison with backbone scalar couplings for weakly structured peptides; (iii) comparison with NMR residual dipolar couplings and scalar couplings for both backbone and side-chains in folded proteins; (iv) equilibrium folding of mini-proteins. The results indicate that the revised CHARMM 36 parameters represent an improved model for the modeling and simulation studies of proteins, including studies of protein folding, assembly and functionally relevant conformational changes.

To overcome this, as well as make other improvements in the model, we present a combination of refinements that should result in enhanced accuracy in simulations of proteins. The common (non Gly, Pro) backbone CMAP potential has been refined against experimental solution NMR data for weakly structured peptides, resulting in a rebalancing of the energies of the α-helix and extended regions of the Ramachandran map, correcting the α-helical bias of CHARMM22/CMAP. The Gly and Pro CMAPs have been refitted to more accurate quantum-mechanical energy surfaces. Side-chain torsion parameters have been optimized by fitting to backbone-dependent quantum-mechanical energy surfaces, followed by additional empirical optimization targeting NMR scalar couplings for unfolded proteins. A comprehensive validation of the revised force field was then performed against data not used to guide parametrization: (i) comparison of simulations of eight proteins in their crystal environments with crystal structures; (ii) comparison with backbone scalar couplings for weakly structured peptides; (iii) comparison with NMR residual dipolar couplings and scalar couplings for both backbone and side-chains in folded proteins; (iv) equilibrium folding of mini-proteins. The results indicate that the revised CHARMM 36 parameters represent an improved model for the modeling and simulation studies of proteins, including studies of protein folding, assembly and functionally relevant conformational changes.},

ACEMD is a production-class biomolecular dynamics (MD) engine supporting CHARMM and AMBER force fields. Designed specifically for GPUs it is able to achieve supercomputing scale performance of 40 ns/day for all-atom protein systems with over 23?000 atoms. We provide a validation and performance evaluation of the code and run a microsecond-long trajectory for an all-atom molecular system in explicit TIP3P water on a single workstation computer equipped with just 3 GPUs. We believe that microsecond time scale molecular dynamics on cost-effective hardware will have important methodological and scientific implications.},

	abstract = {Molecular mechanics force fields are widely used in computer-aided drug design for the study of drug-like molecules alone or interacting with biological systems. In simulations involving biological macromolecules, the biological part is typically represented by a specialized biomolecular force field, while the drug is represented by a matching general (organic) force field. In order to apply these general force fields to an arbitrary drug-like molecule, functionality for assignment of atom types, parameters, and charges is required. In the present article, which is part I of a series of two, we present the algorithms for bond perception and atom typing for the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF). The CGenFF atom typer first associates attributes to the atoms and bonds in a molecule, such as valence, bond order, and ring membership among others. Of note are a number of features that are specifically required for CGenFF. This information is then used by the atom typing routine to assign CGenFF atom types based on a programmable decision tree. This allows for straightforward implementation of CGenFF?s complicated atom typing rules and for equally straightforward updating of the atom typing scheme as the force field grows. The presented atom typer was validated by assigning correct atom types on 477 model compounds including in the training set as well as 126 test-set molecules that were constructed to specifically verify its different components. The program may be utilized via an online implementation at https://www.paramchem.org/ .},
